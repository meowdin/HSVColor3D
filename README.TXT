HSV/HSL Color To 3D Space Coordinate using RGB.
========================

Project Introduction:

This program is a small toy, which input all possible value of HSL(hue, saturation, and lightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, and value) model. Then map the calculated result with X-Y-X (3D) coordinate.

Project developed for acedemic purpose.

Notes:
- To run the project, just run HSVColor3D.jar with /lib folder side by side.
- As Java3D is platform independence, it's recomanded to install Java3D to your system following their specificationl. Alternately, you may place the binary(libj3dcore-ogl.so for linux, j3dcore-ogl.dll for windows) side by side with the JAR while executing.
- Project was developed using NetBean 8.0.2. You may just add existing project with netbean, and select this project root path.
